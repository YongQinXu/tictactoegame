# tictactoegame

Hey, welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game!

Basically, this is just a simple little game I made to show off my skills working with C++.
It's nothing fancy, but it works for the most part.

So, the way this goes is that you click on the executable included in this folder, which should open up
a little terminal window for you. The game should start as soon as you run the executable file, and all
you really need to input throughouth the entire process are either simple y/n character commands, or 
numbers that correspond to certain options.

For example, if a menu goes like:
1 Option A
2 Option B
3 Option C
or something like that, then all you gotta do is type in the number you want and press enter.
No need to enter the entire option's name or anything that complicated.

In terms of the game itself, it's just tictactoe. You choose a number from 1-9 corresponding to a space 
on the game board that you want to place your piece into, and whoever gets three in a row wins.

You can play it singleplayer against a computer that chooses random spaces, or you can just play it with
two real-life humans by selecting the appropriate mode when the menu comes up and passing the keyboard 
to a friend when it's their turn.

I've also included my source code for this project so others can use it for reference in their own projects.
I chose a creative commons license for a reason, after all.

This folder includes the .cpp source code file, the .exe game file, the license, and this read me file.
Everything should be fairly straightforward, so I hope you enjoy. Thanks for playing.
